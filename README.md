* Accurately drive in a straight line, correcting its path by detecting a black line drawn on the ground
* Detect different grayscale shades off of a line
* Play different musical notes corresponding to the grayscale shades on the line
* Manually Supply a Sine Wave with Correct Frequency to a Speaker
